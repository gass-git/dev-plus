      For me coding is a <span className="highlight">catalyst for creation</span>, to portray 
      an idea into reality and be able to interact with it anywhere on 
      the world I find it to be fascinating, it is the <span className="highlight">reason</span> I got hooked at age 14.
      This <span className="highlight">feeling</span> is 
      something I always try to tap into when I'm developing projects...

      My main interest is to <span className="highlight"> enjoy the process and 
      challenges</span> that appear on the coding coast but
      at the same time make cool things and hopefully <span className="highlight">add value to peoples lifes</span>. 
    </Fragment>,
    <Fragment>
      This is mainly where I want to be, in the <span className="highlight">world of ideas</span>
      , logic and <span className="highlight">mental labyrinth</span>.  The hunger for challenge is never satisfied, so I'm always
        pushing myself to go beyond, for the pure joy of it.
